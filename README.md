# Kheperax

The *Kheperax* task is a re-implementation of the `fastsim` simulator from _Mouret and Doncieux (2012)_.
Kheperax is fully written using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), to leverage hardware accelerators and massive parallelization.

## Task Properties

Each episode is run for a fixed amount of timesteps (by default equal to `250`).
The agent corresponds to a Khepera-like robot that moves in a planar 2-dimensional maze.
This robot has (by default):
- 3 lasers to estimate its distance to some walls in specific directions (by default -45, 0 and 45 degrees).
- 2 bumpers to detect contact with walls.
At each time-step, the agent receives an observation, which corresponds to all laser and bumper measures: 
```
# by default:
[laser 1, laser 2, laser 3, bumper left, bumper right]
```
The bumpers return `1` if there's a contact with a wall and `-1` otherwise.

The actions to pass to the environment should be between `-1` and `1`. 
They are then scaled depending on a scale defined in the environment configuration.

**Quality-Diversity Properties**:
- Fitness: sum of negated norm of actions (-1 * sum of norm a_t, ~negated energy)
- Descriptor: final 2-dimensional location of the robot.

## Task Configuration

The `KheperaxTask` takes as input a `KheperaxConfig` object, organised as follows:

`KheperaxConfig`
- `Robot`:
  - `posture`: initial `Posture` (containing position and orientation)
  - `radius`: robot radius
  - `laser_ranges`: laser max ranges.
  - `laser_angles`: angles of placement of the lasers on the robot
  - `std_noise_sensor_measures`: standard deviation of the gaussian noise applied to the sensor measures.
  - `lasers_return_minus_one_if_out_of_range`: 
  If `True`, then the lasers return `-1` if their measure is out of range (like in the original implementation).
  If `False`, then returns the max laser range.
- `Maze`:
  - `walls`: tree of `Segments` representing the placement of the walls in the environment.
- `action_scale`: all the commanded wheel velocities will be between -1 * `action_scale` and `action_scale`
- `std_noise_wheel_velocities`: standard deviation of the gaussian noise applied to the wheel velocities.
- `resolution`: resolution of the maze when calling `env.render(...)` 

To get an initial configuration, you can run:
```python
config_kheperax = KheperaxConfig.get_default()
```

You can then modify the properties of the config by directly changing its attributes.


## Kheperax with a target
In order to use Kheperax with a target position to reach at the end of the maze, you can use the `TargetKheperaxTask` class. The target position is set by defualt in `(0.15, 0.9)` with a radius of `0.05`. The reward at each step is defined as the negative distance to the target center, and reaching the target position ends the episode.   
Rendering the environment will then show the target position as a green circle.
